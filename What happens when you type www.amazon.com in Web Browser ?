What happens when you type www.amazon.com in Web Browser, how server handle requests, how routing works, difference between HTTP and HTTPS, how TCP works. Explain everthing.
When you enter something like www.amazon.com the request goes to one of many special computers on the Internet known as Domain Name Servers (DNS). All these requests are routed through various routers and switches. The domain name servers keep tables of machine names and their IP addresses, so when you type in www.amazon.com it gets translated into a number, which identifies the computers that serve the Google Website to you.

When you want to view any page on the Web, you must initiate the activity by requesting a page using your browser. The browser asks a domain name server to translate the domain name you requested into an IP address. The browser then sends a request to that server for the page you want, using a standard called Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

The server should constantly be connected to the Internet, ready to serve pages to visitors. When it receives a request, it looks for the requested document and returns it to the Web browser. When a request is made, the server usually logs the client's IP address, the document requested, and the date and time it was requested. This information varies server to server.

An average Web page actually requires the Web browser to request more than one file from the Web server and not just the HTML / XHTML page, but also any images, style sheets, and other resources used in the web page. Each of these files including the main page needs a URL to identify each item. Then each item is sent by the Web server to the Web browser and Web browser collects all this information and displays them in the form of Web page.

First of all, let us begin with understanding how we get connected to the internet so that we are able to request web pages like amazon.com.Every computer connected to the internet needs an IP ADDRESS.This IP address is unique for any computer connected to the internet(on a local network For eg. a group of friends using the same wifi router, it is the ip address of the router which is unique).There is a misconception that the IP ADDRESS that you see when you open the list of connected devices to the internet from the same router is the unique IP address but no it is unique only to the private network which is your home network.Many other computers can have the same IP address at the same time when they are on other networks.so now when you see an IP address like 192.168.1.1 you don't have to shout out that no one else connected to the internet has the same IP Address.this is your private IP addressYour mac address is unique and yes you can safely say that your mac address is the only mac address connected on the internet at any point of time.

Now coming back to the IP address of the router which is dynamically assigned every time you want to connect to the internet, using the DHCP protocol which comes along with the TCP/IP protocol suite networking software.

DHCP is part of the application layer and assigns a router a unique IP ADDRESS for some time on a lease.This unique number is assigned from the pool of addresses available with your internet service provider in the DHCP server.

Now that you are connected to the internet ..you will request for the page www.amazon.com.The browser now communicates with the browser cache to check if this site is previously visited and it has the IP Address of the website.If not present then it searches the OS cache, router cache, ISP DNS cache then a recursive search into ISP's DNS server begins until it finds the required IP address. After obtaining the IP the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.The server sends an HTML response back to the client.The browser now begins to render the HTML and sends the request for objects embedded in HTML as many sites deliver their CSS, Images, files and scripts from a content delivery network (CDN). The browser will again send the HTTP GET request for each of the embedded URL which again goes by the same procedure of look up and other above mention steps. After this, the browser may send further AJAX request to communicate with the web server even after the page is rendered.
